## Ironsworn/Starforged Tip - Use Custom Folders to add Character Sheet Oracles 
* Use this method to add the Augmented Reality kit.
* If it does not already exist, create a `Custom Oracles` folder in `Rollable Tables` tab called:
  * `Custom Oracles` - EN
  * `Oráculos personalizados` - ES
  * `Oracles personnalisés` - FR
  * `Własne Wyrocznie` - PL

Open the `Augmented Reality Rolltables` compendium and copy the folders into the `Rollable Tables` `Custom Oracles` folder.
