AN INTRODUCTION  BRING THE
                 CYBERPUNK
                 Over on the Views From The Edge forum ( http://vfte.cyberpunk.co.uk ), I put forward the
                 idea of group-creating a cyberpunk city kit, intending to provide a variety of table-based
                 resources designed to quickly add both detail and flavour to cities on the fly.
                 Being largely based in complex urban sprawls, most cyberpunk games tend to provide
                 city source material as standard, but are largely based on the model of a mish-mash of
                 detailed locations, leaving large voids and lacking a lot of flavour. What we felt was needed
                 was something more fluid, a kit rather than a sourcebook, that could be used as the game
                 is in progress, following the philosophy of 'maximum table utility'. We defined it as
                 something that could be used during the game, was simple to access, sparked ideas with
                 a simple sentence, and both added to the game's evolving environment and to play.
                 Also, making the kit system agnostic was essential, as not everyone plays R.Talsorian's
                 Cyberpunk 2020®.
                 Richard Balmer, creator of the Vircades Project and Views From The Edge luminary, said it
                 best when he summarised the project as "taking things you know and adding layers of
                 science fictional strangeness to make it new and exciting" and "to add cyberpunk to the
                 world as it is." With that firmly in mind, some pixels were wrangled and tables started to
                 form, resulting in the content of this book. Hopefully, we have achieved our aim and the
                 ideas within will aid struggling cyberpunk gamesmasters in adding futuristic layers to their
                 campaign worlds, with a minimum of effort.
                 Whether your players prowl the mean streets of Night City, the Seattle Sprawl, Neo Tokyo,
                 Cape Town or Budapest 2060, the tables and NPCs of Augmented Reality will enable you
                 to spice-up any dark future metroplex when you're caught off guard.
                 Enjoy.

DROP DOWN GRID
The Downtown Drop Down Grid is designed to enable unprepared or improvising
cyberpunk GMs to generate the immediate urban environment, quickly and easily,
simply by dropping some dice and checking where they land.

DROP DOWN GRID
The Instacitizen Drop Down Grid is designed to enable unprepared or improvising
cyberpunk GMs to generate city dwellers in the immediate area, quickly and easily,
simply by dropping some dice and checking where they land.
How it works: First, print out that strange looking  each dice can be used in different ways; to
grid to the left. Then, grab a few D10s, four or     ascertain the number of people in a group, as the
five being a good number, and drop them onto         NPC's prime stat for their role, and to determine
that grid. Where each of the dice lands will tell    if the citizens have any quirks or notable features
you the type of people your players have in their    on the First Impressions tables (optional; choose
immediate area. Now, the numbers shown on            a table for each NPC generated). Decide gender.

street samurai, corporate players and insane hackers, along with
easy to roll cabbies, cops, gang members and street fighters.

the immediate urban environment, all painted with a broad brush,
to enable gamesmasters to let their twisted imaginations shine
through, without slowing down the action.

use these tables to bring them the bleeding-edge future. So, jack
in now and augment your reality...
